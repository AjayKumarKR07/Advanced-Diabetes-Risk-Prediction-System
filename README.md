🏥 Advanced Diabetes Risk Prediction System
AI-Powered Clinical Screening & Medical Recommendation Platform








🚀 Project Overview

Diabetes is one of the most dangerous chronic diseases worldwide and often remains undiagnosed until advanced stages.

Advanced Diabetes Risk Prediction System is a full-stack medical AI platform that predicts diabetes risk using Machine Learning and provides condition-specific medical recommendations, lab test suggestions, and clinical action plans via an interactive hospital-style dashboard.

Unlike basic ML models, this system behaves like real hospital screening software with confidence-based medical decision support.

> AI-powered medical screening system with disease-specific clinical recommendations and interactive dashboards.


## 🚀 Project Overview

Diabetes is one of the most life-threatening chronic diseases worldwide and often remains undiagnosed until advanced stages.  
This project presents a full-stack medical AI system that predicts the probability of diabetes using machine learning and provides condition-specific medical recommendations, diagnostic test suggestions, and immediate action plans through a professional hospital-style dashboard.


## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 Random Forest machine learning model  
- ⚙ Advanced feature engineering for metabolic risk detection  
- 📊 Interactive Streamlit medical dashboard  
- 🩺 Disease-specific medical recommendations  
- 🎯 Confidence-based risk stratification  
- 📈 Risk gauge and contributing factor analysis  
- 🏥 Professional hospital-style UI

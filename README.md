🏥 Advanced Diabetes Risk Prediction System

AI-powered clinical screening system with disease-specific medical recommendations

🚀 Project Overview

Diabetes is one of the most dangerous chronic diseases worldwide and often remains undiagnosed until advanced stages.
This project is a full-stack medical AI system that predicts diabetes risk using machine learning and provides condition-specific medical recommendations, test suggestions, and action plans through an interactive clinical dashboard.

Unlike basic ML projects, this system simulates real hospital screening software with confidence-based medical decision support.

✨ Key Features

🔬 Random Forest ML model trained on Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

🧠 Advanced feature engineering for metabolic risk detection

📊 Interactive clinical dashboard using Streamlit + Plotly

🩺 Disease-specific recommendations (Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity, Insulin Resistance etc.)

🎯 Confidence-based risk stratification

📈 Risk gauge, factor analysis, and parameter insights

⚡ Real-time prediction engine

🏥 Professional hospital-style UI
